Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  --This project is meant to help with inventory for a grocery store.  The project reads in a text file of all items sold at the end of a day.  The user has 3 options.
  1. Enter a word they wish to look up and the program will return how many times that word is present in the file.
  2. All items in the list print with the number of times they are in the file.
  3. All the items in the list print with * for the number of times they appear in the file.
The program also creates a backup file with all the items and amounts for data purposes.  The user does not interact with this file.      
The program handles reading and creating the files pretty well.  There isn't much for validation in the code.  Adding some minor validations for entry from the user would make the code better.
The sticking point in the code that was the most challenging was printing the histogram or the count of each items as a *.  I was able to figure out how to do the number count and display it,
but outputting the count as stars was more difficult.   I was able to use the tutoring services that SNHU provides and Google for figure everything out. Antoher challenge was
the online coding environment. It grew more problematic over the course and became frusterating to work in. I was able to download Visual Studio on my computer and that worked much better.  
I spent more time on this progrect planning out how I wanted to tackle the tasks.  I broke down tasks into smaller parts so it wasn't as overwhelming.  I found that worked really well for me
and that is a skill I will continue to develop and use.  It helps to have your thoughts organazied in a plan of attack before you start coding.  I tried to make this program clear and simple.
I added alot of comments into the code to explain what I was doing. I do think it helps for anyone looking at the code or even if I go back to it several months later to see what I was trying
to accomplish with a certain line. I think this makes code more maintainable when you know what the code is doing. I did not leave giant gaps between code blocks.  I spaced everything
evenly which makes the code easier to read.
